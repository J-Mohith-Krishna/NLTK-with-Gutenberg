# NLTK-with-Gutenberg
## Description-
This Python script utilizes the NLTK library to access the Gutenberg corpus, a collection of literary texts. It lists available files in the corpus and retrieves and prints the text of a specific document (in this case, 'shakespeare-hamlet.txt.txt'). The main function demonstrates corpus access and document text retrieval.
## Explanation-
    -Downloading Gutenberg Corpus: Uses NLTK to download the Gutenberg corpus if it's not already present.

    -access_gutenberg_corpus function: Lists the available files in the Gutenberg corpus and accesses the text of a specific document (in this case, 'shakespeare-hamlet.txt.txt').

    -main function: Invokes the access_gutenberg_corpus function to demonstrate corpus access and document text retrieval.

    -__name__ == "__main__" condition: Ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run, not when it's imported as a module.
